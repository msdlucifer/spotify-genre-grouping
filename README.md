# Spotify Genre Grouping

## Project Overview
Spotify Genre Grouping is a machine learning–based project that focuses on classifying and grouping music tracks into different genres using their audio features. The project aims to analyze patterns in musical characteristics and understand how various attributes influence genre classification.

## Problem Statement
With the rapid growth of digital music platforms, organizing large music libraries into meaningful genres has become challenging. Manual genre classification is time-consuming and subjective. This project addresses the problem by applying machine learning techniques to automatically group Spotify tracks into genres based on their audio feature data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of Spotify audio features such as tempo, loudness, energy, danceability, acousticness, valence, speechiness, and instrumentalness. These features capture the musical characteristics of each track and are used to identify similarities between songs and assign them to appropriate genre groups.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Feature correlation analysis
- Genre grouping using machine learning techniques
- Interpretation of results and insights

## Results and Insights
The analysis shows that features such as energy, tempo, danceability, and valence play a significant role in distinguishing music genres. Correlation analysis and visualizations help in understanding the relationship between audio features and genre classification.
